1. Discovery: Discovery is the first step of VM life cycle. It is the process of discovering assets present within the network.
2. Organize Assets: In this phase, assets are organized into different groups depending on various factors, which includes their risk factor and threat impact.
3. Assess: After organizing the assets, assess helps an administrator to perform vulnerability scans to find any vulnerabilities that might result in a security breach.
4. Report: Based on the discovered vulnerable assets, administrators can generate reports to prioritize the identified vulnerabilities, based on their impact.
5. Remediate: Depending on their risk factor and threat impact, remediation plans could be created and implemented.
6. Verify: This phase of the VM lifecycle checks if remediation actions were successful to what extent.
