## 2. Scanner Appliance: `Act as a proxy server b/w Host & Qualys App`
- `VMDR > Scans > Appliances > New >`
- A dedicated `device or virtual machine` deployed within the network.
- To conduct in-depth network-based scans, including authenticated and non-authenticated scans.
- `External Scanner: Included in Qualys Subs` to scan external public IPs
- `Virtual Scanner/Appliance: Need to set up`, To scan internal assets.

### Qualys Gateway Service (QGS): `Acts as a proxy between the internal network and the Qualys Cloud Platform`
- Routes scan data from internal scanners to the Qualys Cloud Platform over a secure, encrypted connection, eliminating the need to open inbound firewall ports or strict firewall rules.
- Typically, this involves allowing HTTPS (port 443).

## 3. Target Host Assets:
- Select the Assets option to specify the scan target using any combination of IP addresses, asset groups and FQDNs.
- Option 1: Net Blocks (`IP/IP range`)
- Option 2: `Asset Groups` (Any Host in subs can be added to the asset group)
- Option 3: `Asset Tags` (a way to manage assets in Dynamic/Automated Solution)
