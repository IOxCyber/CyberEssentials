1. Target Section `allows users to add or remove items from the scope, as well as access issue definitions, which are common vulnerabilities and web exploitation tips.`
2. Comparer: tool that can `compare byte by byte or words`, and users can customize its appearance in the Miscellaneous tab.
3. Proxy tab in Burp Suite provides a comprehensive `view of all traffic through your browser and the application.`
4. Spider tool `crawls a website for links and adds them to the target tab.`
5. Intruder: allow users to instrument requests like `programmatic attacks, with custom payload lists and filtering of output during fuzzing attacks.`

6. A robots.txt file: `text file placed in the root directory of a website that provides instructions to web crawlers (robots) about which pages or sections of the site should not be crawled or indexed.` This helps manage crawler traffic to the site and avoid overloading the server with too many requests.
7. The decoder tool is `used to decode strings that have been encoded using different formats` such as base 64, ASCII, hex, etc.
8. The `scan tab allows users to view issues per domain or specific paths.` Issues are organized in an ordered fashion, with color-coded schemes and icons.
9. `Manual fuzzing might be necessary when testing for cross-site scripting or reflection bugs in specific parts of an application.`
10. The `content discovery tool can be used to search for files and directories`, as well as to analyze targets and engage with intruders.

13. `Burp Suite is a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)` Software. This means that it provides insights into how your web applications behave and function while they are in production and after that.
14. Burp Suite collaborator can be described as a tool or a network service that is used to help the user in the discovery of different kinds of vulnerabilities. This happens when it runs as a single server. It also uses its domain names.
## 15. `Burp infiltrator should not be used on systems like production. This is because these systems require correction in either performance or operation.`
