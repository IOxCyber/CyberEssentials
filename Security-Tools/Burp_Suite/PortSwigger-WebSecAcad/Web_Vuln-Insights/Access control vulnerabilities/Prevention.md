# Broken Access Control `Prevention Techniques`

## 1. **Never rely on obfuscation alone for access control**
   - Always use proper access control mechanisms rather than just hiding links or files.

## 2. **Deny access by default**
   - Assume everything is private and explicitly make resources public if necessary.

## 3. **Use a single application-wide mechanism**
   - Enforce access controls consistently throughout your application using a unified approach.

## 4. **Mandatory declarations of access at the code level**
   - Developers should explicitly declare access permissions for each resource.

## 5. **Audit and test access controls**
   - Regularly review and test your access control mechanisms to ensure they are effective.
