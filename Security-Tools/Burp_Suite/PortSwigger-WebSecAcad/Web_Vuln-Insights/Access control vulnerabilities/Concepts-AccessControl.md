## Access Control:
- Access control is the application of constraints on who or what is authorized to perform actions or access resources.
- Dependent on `authentication and session management.`

## Types:
- Vertical access controls:
  - Mechanisms that `restrict access to sensitive functionality` to specific types of users. eg. Only Admin can access admin related functionality.
  - Parameter-based access control methods: Anything from `preset query string parameter, cookies, A hidden field.`

- Horizontal access controls: mechanisms that `restrict access to resources` to specific users. eg. A user can access only their account info but not others.

## Example:
-  `vertical privilege escalation`: if a non-administrative user can gain access to an admin page where they can delete user accounts.
