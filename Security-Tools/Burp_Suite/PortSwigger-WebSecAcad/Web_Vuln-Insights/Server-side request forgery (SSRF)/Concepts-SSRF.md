# SSRF: Server Side Request Forgery
- Vulnerability `that allows an attacker to cause the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location.`
- Unintended locations such as arbitrary external systems or Internal resources.



# Common SSRF attacks:

- These trust relationships might exist in `relation to the server, or in relation to other back-end systems` within the same organization.
