# Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS):
`A browser mechanism which enables controlled access to resources located outside of a given domain.`

- The same-origin policy is a restrictive cross-origin specification that limits the ability for a website to interact with resources outside of the source domain.
> CORS is not a protection against cross-origin attacks such as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
