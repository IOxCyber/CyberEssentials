## 1. Handle User Credentials Securely
Never send login data over unencrypted connections.
Enforce HTTPS by redirecting all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
Ensure usernames or email addresses are not exposed through public profiles or reflected in HTTP responses.

## 2. Implement Effective Password Policies
Use password checkers like zxcvbn to encourage secure passwords rather than relying on traditional policies.
Provide real-time feedback on password strength to users.
Allow only passwords that meet the required strength to be used.

## 3. Prevent Username Enumeration
Use identical error messages for both valid and invalid usernames.
Return the same HTTP status code and ensure similar response times for all login attempts.

## 4. Protect Against Brute-Force Attacks
Implement IP-based rate limiting.
Require CAPTCHA after a certain number of failed login attempts.
Prevent attackers from manipulating their IP addresses.

## 5. Audit and Secure Verification Logic
Regularly audit authentication logic to eliminate potential flaws.
Ensure that verification and validation checks cannot be bypassed.

## 6. Secure Supplementary Authentication Functions
Pay attention to password reset and change mechanisms.
Ensure supplementary functions are as secure as the primary login mechanisms.

## 7. Implement Robust Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Use dedicated apps or devices for generating MFA codes.
Avoid SMS-based 2FA due to potential abuse (e.g., SIM swapping).
Ensure MFA logic is well-implemented and cannot be bypassed.
