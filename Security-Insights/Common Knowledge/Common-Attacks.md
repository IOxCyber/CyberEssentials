## Cyber Attacks: 

### 1. Teardrop attack:
- A teardrop attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack (an attack that attempts to make a computer resource unavailable by flooding a network or server with requests and data.)

### 2. Man-in-the-Middle attack:
- refers to the vulnerability where an attacker intercepts and modifies communication between a user and a server, allowing them to eavesdrop, manipulate data, or impersonate the parties involved.

### 3. Bluesnarfing: 
- a serious cyberattack where attackers gain unauthorized access to Bluetooth-enabled devices. This access is used to steal sensitive data, which is then used for malicious activities.
- Bluetooth attack techniques that are used to send messages to users without the recipient's consent

### 4. Rubber-hose" attack:
- extraction of cryptographic secrets (e.g. the password to an encrypted file) from a person by coercion or tortureâ€”such as beating that person with a rubber hose, hence the name.

### 5. Session splicing:
- an `IDS evasion technique` in which an `attacker delivers data in multiple, small-sized packets` to the target computer, making it `very difficult for an IDS to detect` the attack signatures.
- `Attacker can use Nessus or Whisker` to perform an attack.

### 6. Boot sector virus: 
- A type of malware that `infects a system's boot partition` or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a hard disk.
- The `virus executes malicious code`, during startup and before security software can be executed.

### 7. Web Parameter[More](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/how-to-use-url-parameters):
- Tampering attack is based on the manipulation of parameters exchanged between client and server in order to modify application data, such as user credentials and permissions, price and quantity of products, etc.
- Web Parameter: the Value Passed thu the Put request in URL.

### 8. Jailbreaking:
- `modify a smartphone or other electronic device to remove restrictions` imposed by the manufacturer or operator, e.g. to `allow the installation of unauthorized software.`
- the process of exploiting the flaws of a locked-down electronic device to install software other than what the manufacturer has made available for that device.

### 9. Social Engineering:

## 10. Common Cyber Attacks:
### 1. **Phishing:**
   - *Definition:* Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising it as a trustworthy entity in electronic communication.
   - *Prevention:* Educate users about recognizing phishing emails, use email filters, and implement two-factor authentication.

### 2. **Malware:**
   - *Definition:* Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.
   - *Prevention:* Install reputable antivirus software, keep systems updated, and exercise caution when downloading files or clicking on links.

### 3. **Ransomware:**
   - *Definition:* Ransomware encrypts a user's files and demands payment for their release.
   - *Prevention:* Regularly back up data, use robust cybersecurity software, and educate users about the risks of clicking on unknown links.

### 4. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:**
   - *Definition:* MitM attacks involve intercepting and possibly altering communication between two parties without their knowledge.
   - *Prevention:* Use encryption (SSL/TLS), avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities, and implement secure communication protocols.

### 5. **Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks:**
   - *Definition:* DoS attacks overwhelm a system, service, or network to disrupt normal functioning and deny access to legitimate users.
   - *Prevention:* Implement firewalls, load balancing, and intrusion prevention systems to mitigate and absorb attack traffic.

### 6. **SQL Injection:**
   - *Definition:* SQL injection involves inserting malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate a database.
   - *Prevention:* Use parameterized queries, validate user input, and restrict database permissions.

### 7. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**
   - *Definition:* XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
   - *Prevention:* Validate and sanitize user input, use secure coding practices, and implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).

### 8. **Zero-Day Exploits:**
   - *Definition:* Zero-day exploits target vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to the vendor or security community.
   - *Prevention:* Keep software updated, use intrusion detection systems, and deploy endpoint protection.

### 9. **Social Engineering:**
   - *Definition:* Social engineering manipulates individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
   - *Prevention:* Educate users on recognizing social engineering tactics, establish strict access controls, and implement multi-factor authentication.

### 10. **Password Attacks:**
   - *Definition:* Password attacks involve unauthorized attempts to access an account by guessing or cracking passwords.
   - *Prevention:* Encourage strong, unique passwords, implement multi-factor authentication, and regularly update password policies.
