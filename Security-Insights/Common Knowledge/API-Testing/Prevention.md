## Preventing vulnerabilities in APIs:
- When designing APIs, make sure that security is a consideration from the beginning. In particular, make sure that you:
```
Secure your documentation: if you don't intend your API to be publicly accessible.
Ensure your documentation is kept up to date so that legitimate testers have full visibility of the API's attack surface.
Apply an allowlist of permitted HTTP methods.
Validate that the content type is expected for each request or response.
Use generic error messages to avoid giving away information that may be useful for an attacker.
Use protective measures on all versions of your API, not just the current production version.
```

## General Recommendations to Prevent Exploitation:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Ensure users have proper permissions for each action (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.).
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all incoming data, regardless of the HTTP method.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by implementing rate limits on critical endpoints.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Continuously monitor API traffic and log all activity to detect anomalies.
- **CSRF Protection**: Use anti-CSRF tokens and same-site cookies.
- **Security Headers**: Implement headers like **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**, **X-Frame-Options**, **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**, and **X-XSS-Protection**.


> Rate Limiting means restricting how many times a user can make a request to a certain part of an application (called an endpoint) within a specific time frame.
