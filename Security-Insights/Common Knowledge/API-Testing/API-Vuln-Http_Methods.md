# Web vulnerabilities in HTTP methods used by APIs
- These vulnerabilities often arise from improper input validation, authentication issues, or lack of security controls.
- Below is a list of vulnerabilities associated with each HTTP method, along with examples of how they can be exploited and how to prevent them.

---

### **1. GET Vulnerability**
- **Vulnerability**: **Information Disclosure** and **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object References)**
  
#### **Example:**
```http
GET /api/user/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```
- **Before Exploit**: An attacker can manipulate the user ID (`123`) in the URL to access data they shouldn't (e.g., another user's account).
- **Exploit**: Changing the ID in the URL to `GET /api/user/124` could grant access to another user's data if access controls are not implemented.
- **Impact**: The attacker retrieves unauthorized user information.

#### **Prevention**:
- Implement strong **access control** to ensure users can only access their data.
- Validate user input properly.
- Use URL encryption or tokens to hide sensitive information like user IDs.

### **2. POST Vulnerability**
- **Vulnerability**: **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**

#### **Example:**
```http
POST /api/user/update HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "attacker@example.com"
}
```
- **Before Exploit**: If CSRF protections aren't in place, an attacker can trick an authenticated user into submitting a POST request from another site.
- **Exploit**: The attacker can craft a malicious form on their website. When the victim (who is authenticated) visits the page, the form auto-submits and changes their account details without their knowledge.
- **Impact**: The attacker updates the victim's profile with attacker-controlled data.

#### **Prevention**:
- Use **anti-CSRF tokens** in sensitive forms.
- Implement **same-site cookies** to prevent cross-origin requests.
- Ensure **strong authentication** mechanisms.

### **3. PUT Vulnerability**
- **Vulnerability**: **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**

#### **Example:**
```http
PUT /api/user/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "attacker@example.com"
}
```
- **Before Exploit**: If a user can modify any account by changing the `123` in the URL, it could allow unauthorized modification of other users' data.
- **Exploit**: The attacker could change the `123` to another user's ID (e.g., `124`) and update the email of that account.
- **Impact**: The attacker modifies another user's profile.

#### **Prevention**:
- Use **authorization checks** to ensure users can only modify their data.
- Perform **input validation** on user IDs.
- Implement **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure only authorized users can update sensitive data.

### **4. DELETE Vulnerability**
- **Vulnerability**: **Broken Authentication or Missing Authorization**

#### **Example:**
```http
DELETE /api/user/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```
- **Before Exploit**: If the server does not verify whether the user has permission to delete, an attacker could delete resources they shouldn't have access to.
- **Exploit**: The attacker could send a `DELETE` request to `/api/user/124`, deleting another user's account.
- **Impact**: The attacker deletes a resource (e.g., a user account, record, or file).

#### **Prevention**:
- Ensure **strong authorization** is in place to validate user permissions.
- Implement **rate-limiting** to avoid abuse.
- Require confirmation before deletion (e.g., soft deletes, confirmation prompts).

---

### **5. OPTIONS Vulnerability**
- **Vulnerability**: **Information Disclosure**

#### **Example:**
```http
OPTIONS /api/user HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```
- **Before Exploit**: An attacker can send an OPTIONS request to gather information about the allowed HTTP methods for a specific resource.
- **Exploit**: The server responds with:
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
```
- **Impact**: The attacker gains knowledge about the API's attack surface (e.g., allowed methods, potential entry points for exploitation).

#### **Prevention**:
- Limit the information returned in **OPTIONS** responses.
- Use **authentication** to restrict OPTIONS requests to trusted users.
- Implement **CORS** policies properly to avoid cross-origin attacks.

---

### **6. PATCH Vulnerability**
- **Vulnerability**: **Improper Data Validation**

#### **Example:**
```http
PATCH /api/user/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "attacker@example.com"
}
```
- **Before Exploit**: If the API does not validate the input data or permissions correctly, an attacker can partially update a resource (e.g., changing email).
- **Exploit**: The attacker sends a PATCH request to modify sensitive fields (like email) on another user's account.
- **Impact**: The attacker alters another user's account data.

#### **Prevention**:
- Perform **input validation** on partial updates.
- Check **authorization** before applying PATCH changes.
- Ensure **proper validation rules** for each field being updated.

---

### **7. TRACE Vulnerability**
- **Vulnerability**: **Cross-Site Tracing (XST)**

#### **Example:**
```http
TRACE /api/user HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```
- **Before Exploit**: If TRACE is enabled, the attacker can exploit it to reflect malicious input back to the user, including session cookies.
- **Exploit**: The attacker sends a TRACE request that reflects user information (e.g., cookies) and then intercepts this data.
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: message/http

TRACE /api/user HTTP/1.1
Cookie: session=xyz
Host: example.com
```
- **Impact**: The attacker retrieves sensitive information, including cookies, which can be used to hijack sessions.

#### **Prevention**:
- **Disable TRACE** on the server.
- Implement **strict security headers** like **X-Content-Type-Options** and **X-XSS-Protection**.
