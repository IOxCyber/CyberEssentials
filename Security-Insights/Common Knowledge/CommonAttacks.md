# Attacks: 

1. teardrop attack:
- A teardrop attack is a type of denial-of-service (DoS) attack (an attack that attempts to make a computer resource unavailable by flooding a network or server with requests and data.)

2. Man-in-the-Middle attack:
- refers to the vulnerability where an attacker intercepts and modifies communication between a user and a server, allowing them to eavesdrop, manipulate data, or impersonate the parties involved.

3. Bluesnarfing: 
- a serious cyberattack where attackers gain unauthorized access to Bluetooth-enabled devices. This access is used to steal sensitive data, which is then used for malicious activities.
- Bluetooth attack techniques that are used in to send messages to users without the recipient's consent

4. rubber-hose" attack:
- extraction of cryptographic secrets (e.g. the password to an encrypted file) from a person by coercion or tortureâ€”such as beating that person with a rubber hose, hence the name.

5. Session splicing:
- an `IDS evasion technique` in which an `attacker delivers data in multiple, small-sized packets` to the target computer, making it `very difficult for an IDS to detect` the attack signatures.
- `Attacker can use Nessus or Whisker` to perform an attack.

6. Boot sector virus: 
- A type of malware that `infects a system's boot partition` or the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a hard disk.
- The `virus executes malicious code`, during startup and before security software can be executed.

7. Web Parameter[More](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/how-to-use-url-parameters):
- Tampering attack is based on the manipulation of parameters exchanged between client and server in order to modify application data, such as user credentials and permissions, price and quantity of products, etc.
- Web Parameter: the Value Passed thu the Put request in URL.

8. Jailbreaking:
- `modify a smartphone or other electronic device to remove restrictions` imposed by the manufacturer or operator, e.g. to `allow the installation of unauthorized software.`
- the process of exploiting the flaws of a locked-down electronic device to install software other than what the manufacturer has made available for that device.
