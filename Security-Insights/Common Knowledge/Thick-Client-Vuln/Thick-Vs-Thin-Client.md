# Thick Client:
- A thick client (also known as a fat client) is a client application in a client-server architecture that performs substantial processing on the client side.
- Processing: executing business logic, handling data validation, and rendering the user interface. It interacts with the server primarily for data storage and retrieval.

```
Example:

Microsoft Office Suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint): These applications run locally on your computer and handle all document creation, editing, and processing tasks.
Adobe Photoshop: A graphic design application that performs intensive image processing tasks on the clientâ€™s machine.
AutoCAD: A computer-aided design (CAD) software that handles complex drawing and modeling tasks.
Video Games: Many modern video games are thick clients that perform heavy graphics rendering and physics calculations on the client side.
Spotify Desktop App: The application handles most of the music playback and user interface locally, while fetching music files and playlists from the server.
```

# Thin Client:
- A thin client is a `client application that relies on the server for most of its processing power and functionality.`
- The thin client `mainly acts as an interface to the server`, where the bulk of data processing, application logic, and storage occur.

```
Example:

Web Browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox): Browsers are thin clients that rely on web servers to deliver content, execute scripts, and handle data processing.
Web-Based Email (e.g., Gmail, Outlook Web App): These applications provide an interface to email services, with most of the processing and storage handled by the email server.
Citrix Receiver or VMware Horizon Client: Used in virtual desktop environments, where the desktop environment is hosted on a remote server, and the thin client just displays the user interface.
Google Docs: While editing documents is done via the browser, the processing and storage are handled by Google's servers.
Remote Desktop Clients: Applications that connect to a remote server or another computer to control it, with all processing occurring on the remote machine.
