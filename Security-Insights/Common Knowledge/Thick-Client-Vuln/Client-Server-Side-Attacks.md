## Client-Side attacks:
1. Files Analysis: Applications usually store information in local files and the registry.

 2. Identifying DLL Hijacking Vulnerability: DLL hijacking is an attack that exploits the Windows search and load algorithm, allowing an attacker to inject code into an application through disk manipulation.

## Proxy-Aware: Thick Clients are easier to work with when it comes to intercepting and analyzing traffic since they can be configured to use a proxy directly.
## Non-Proxy-Aware: Thick Clients require more advanced techniques to intercept and test network traffic, making them a bit more challenging from a security testing perspective.


## Server-Side Attacks: `OWASP Top 10 2021`

## 1. Broken Access Control (A01:2021)
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - If a thick client does not properly enforce access control, users might gain unauthorized access to certain features or data.
  - Example: Manipulating requests sent by the client to the server could lead to privilege escalation.

## 2. Cryptographic Failures (A02:2021)
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - Thick clients often store data locally or communicate with servers.
  - If encryption is weak or improperly implemented (e.g., storing sensitive data unencrypted), it can lead to data breaches.

## 3. Injection (A03:2021)
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - Thick clients can be vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., SQL, command injection) if they fail to properly validate or sanitize user inputs before sending them to the server or processing them locally.

## 4. Insecure Design (A04:2021)
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - Poor design in thick clients might expose sensitive data, lack proper security controls, or be susceptible to logic flaws that could be exploited by attackers.

## 5. Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021)
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - Misconfigurations in thick client applications, such as improper handling of security settings, can expose the application to various attacks.
  - Example: Hardcoded credentials, improper logging, or lack of proper updates.

## 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components (A06:2021)
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - Thick clients may rely on third-party libraries or components.
  - If these are outdated or vulnerable, the entire application can be at risk.

## 7. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (A10:2021)
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - While SSRF is more common in web applications, thick clients interacting with servers could potentially be exploited in similar ways if they allow an attacker to manipulate the requests sent to a backend server.


## 8. Identification and Authentication Failures (A07:2021) `CLIENT SIDE`
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - Improper authentication or weak passwords can lead to unauthorized access.
  - Example: Storing session tokens insecurely is a common concern.

## 9. Software and Data Integrity Failures (A08:2021) `CLIENT SIDE`
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - Vulnerabilities like tampering with updates or code signing can compromise software integrity.
  - Ensuring that the software checks for tampered files or updates is critical.

## 10. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (A09:2021) `CLIENT SIDE`
- **Relevance to Thick Clients:** 
  - If a thick client does not log security-relevant events or fails to monitor for suspicious activities, it can hinder incident detection and response efforts.


## Additional Considerations for Thick Clients:
- **Local Storage Security:** 
  - Thick clients often store data locally, which can introduce additional risks such as local file inclusion or exposure of sensitive information if not properly encrypted.

### [Reference Repo](https://github.com/Hari-prasaanth/Thick-Client-Pentest-Checklist)

- **Inter-Process Communication:** 
  - Thick clients might communicate with other applications or services on the same machine, which can be a vector for attacks if not properly secured.

- **Network Security:** 
  - Thick clients often interact with remote servers, making it essential to secure network communication (e.g., using TLS) and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
