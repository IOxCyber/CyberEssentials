## Thick Client: [i](https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/thick-client-penetration-testing-methodology)
- A thick client (or fat client) is a type of client-server architecture where the client (end-user device) performs the bulk of processing tasks.
- It is typically installed with software that can operate independently of the central server. Common examples include desktop applications like Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop.
- Thick client pen-testing involves both local and server-side processing and often uses proprietary protocols for communication. [i](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Windows_Binary_Executable_Files_Security_Checks_Project)

## Common Architectures:
1. Two-Tier architecture: `Client App <-> Database Server`
- The application is installed on the client computer and will need to communicate with a database server.

2. Three-Tier architecture: `Client App <-> Application Server <-> Database Server`
- Three-tier architecture has a security advantage over two-tier architecture because it prevents the end-user from communicating directly with the database server.

> Web Server: Serves Static Contents && App Server: Serves Dynamic Contents, interacts with DB Server. && DB Server: Serves DB content. `Web Server <-> App Server <-> DB Server`

## How to test thick client applications:
- `Thick client applications are generally more complicated and customized than web or mobile applications`
```XML
Discovering what technologies are being used on both the client and the server sides.
Figuring out the applicationâ€™s functionality and behavior.
Identifying all of the different entry points for user input.
Understanding the core security mechanisms used by the application.
Identifying common vulnerabilities like languages and frameworks.
```
