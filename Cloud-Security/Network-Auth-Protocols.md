# Network Authentication Protocols:
- `specifically address the authentication needs within a network or networked environment` for verifying the identity of entities (users or devices) attempting `to access network resources or services.`
- `Authentication Process involves mechanisms such as challenge-response, digital certificates, or tokens.`
- Have Network Scope such LAN, WAN etc.
- eg. Kerberos, RADIUS, TACACS+, EAP (used in wireless networks), and CHAP (used in PPP connections)

> Authentication protocols (broader sense) `authenticate entities beyond network environments, including web applications, APIs, operating systems, and distributed systems`.

1. Kerberos:
- a `network authentication protocol` that uses `symmetric key cryptography` and operates based on the concept of `trusted third-party authentication`.
- Kerberos Server or Key Distribution Center - KDC is a `central server that stores authentication information (database)`, two components: `the Authentication Server (AS) and the Ticket-Granting Server (TGS).`
- An `admin creates user accounts in the Kerberos database` for each user & typically specifies the `user's username, password, and other relevant attributes.`
- `Microsoft Windows OS heavily relies on Kerberos for authentication.`
