# URL-101

## Uniform Resource Locator (URL): `Subdomain<>Domain<>TLD`
- `Structure: http://subdomain.domain-name.top-Level-Domain/path-to-resource?parameters`
- `Example: http://www.Example.com/file/name.txt?Open`
> Domain-name = Domain + TLD

## Key Points:
- `Subdomain` consists of any words that come before a URL’s first dot. `eg. www, blog, news etc`
- `domain name` DNS name to reach a website `eg. google.com, linux.org`
- `path to the resource` part to the right of the TLD. It’s often referred to as the folder structure of the website.
- `Top-Level-Domain`: domain extensions aka TLDs are managed by the Domain Name System of the Internet, which controls how domain names are translated into Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses.

- Parameters contain keys and values separated by the equal sign (=). Furthermore, a URL can have multiple variables. In that case, the ampersand symbol (&) will separate each.

> **double slash** (//) - Authority, the hostname with the port of the URL.
> 
> **Semi colon** (:) - Separator, It differentiate the protocol from the domain components.

### URL vs URI vs URN:
- URI: A URI or a uniform resource identifier is a string of characters that generally identifies any web resource by using a name, a location, or both. A uniform resource locator (URL) and a uniform resource name (URN) are the two types of a URI.

- URI schemes are a protocol used to access a resource.
- Authority:
- - Userinfo – includes a username and a password separated by a colon.
- - Host – consists of either an IP address or a registered name. The IP address should be inserted into brackets.
- - Port – a protocol used for connecting the server. It is an optional sub-component followed by a colon.
- The path contains a sequence of data segments that describes the location of a resource in a directory structure. It should be empty or separated by a slash.
- A query is an optional component that contains a query string of non-hierarchical data. It is often a string of key=value pairs.
- a fragment identifier that provides the direction to a secondary resource.
