- A **subdomain** consists of any words or phrases that come before a URL’s first dot. Referring to the world wide web, www is the most common type. It indicates that a website is accessible through the internet and uses HTTP to communicate
- A **domain name** is what users type into their browser’s address bar to reach a website eg. google.com, linux.org
- A **path to the resource** is the part to the right of the TLD. It’s often referred to as the folder structure of the website.
- **Domain Extention**: domain extension aka TLDs are managed by the Domain Name System of the Internet, which controls how domain names are translated into Internet Protocol, or IP, addresses.

- Parameters contain keys and values separated by the equal sign (=). Furthermore, a URL can have multiple variables. In that case, the ampersand symbol (&) will separate each.

### URL vs URI vs URN:
- URI: A URI or a uniform resource identifier is a string of characters that generally identifies any web resource by using a name, a location, or both. A uniform resource locator (URL) and a uniform resource name (URN) are the two types of a URI.

- URI schemes are a protocol used to access a resource.
- Authority:
- - Userinfo – includes a username and a password separated by a colon.
- - Host – consists of either an IP address or a registered name. The IP address should be inserted into brackets.
- - Port – a protocol used for connecting the server. It is an optional sub-component followed by a colon.
- The path contains a sequence of data segments that describes the location of a resource in a directory structure. It should be empty or separated by a slash.
- A query is an optional component that contains a query string of non-hierarchical data. It is often a string of key=value pairs.
- a fragment identifier that provides the direction to a secondary resource.
