## 3 Modules 1-4:

1. Radio frequency identification (RFIDs) tags can be placed in or on objects to track them or monitor sensors for many conditions.

2. Computers use binary codes (eg. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII)) to represent and interpret letters, numbers and special characters with bits.

3. ASCII, abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices.

4. `Bandwidth is the capacity of a medium to carry data.`

5. `Throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits` across the media over a given period of time.

6. The software installed on the computer determines which role the computer plays. Server (Web, File, Email) & Client (Browsers, Outlook/Gmail Apps)

7. A Peer 2 Peer application allows a device to act as both a client and a server within the same communication

## 8. How a text flows from a LAN (Ethernet) to another. `Modem > router > Switch`

1. Modem: `converts digital data from your computer into analog signals`.
- A Modem (short for Modulator-Demodulator) is a device that modulates and demodulates analog signals, allowing digital devices to transmit and receive data over analog communication lines, such as telephone lines or cable systems.

2. Router: `connects different networks together and directs data traffic between them.`
- The router manages the flow of data within your local network and between the local network and the external network (e.g., the internet).
- It uses Network Address Translation (NAT) to map local IP addresses to a single public IP address provided by the ISP.

3. Switch: `A device that connects devices within the same local network and uses MAC addresses to forward data only to the intended device.`

First, the User sends it > It goes to Switch > then It goes to Router > then another router > then Recived at another User end.

9. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides the link between the home network and the internet. An ISP can be the local cable provider, a landline telephone service provider, the cellular network that provides your smartphone service, or an independent provider who leases bandwidth on the physical network infrastructure of another company.

10. A Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) connection is a service that provides high bandwidth, always on, connection using existing land-line telephone wire.

11. Global Positioning System (GPS)
The GPS uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe. The smartphone can receive these signals and calculate the phone’s location to an accuracy of within 10 meters.

12. Near Field Communication (NFC) is a wireless communication technology that enables data to be exchanged by devices that are in very close proximity to each other, usually less than a few centimeters. For example, NFC can be used to connect a smartphone and a payment system. NFC uses electromagnetic fields to transmit data.

```
Wireless wide-area network (WWAN) – It operates in the range of miles.
Wi-Fi – It operates up to distances of 0.18 miles and provides network access to home and corporate users and can include data, voice and video traffic.
Bluetooth – It uses a device-pairing process to communicate over distances of up to 0.05 miles.
GPS - It uses satellites to transmit signals that cover the globe.
