3. Ethernet Frame: `Solely used in LAN for communication`
Ethernet is technology commonly used in local area networks. Devices access the Ethernet LAN using an Ethernet Network Interface Card (NIC). Each Ethernet NIC has a unique address permanently embedded on the card known as a Media Access Control (MAC) address. The MAC address for both the source and destination are fields in an Ethernet frame.
