### To Remember: All People Seem To Need Data Processing. (APSTNDP)

1. Layer 1, the Physical Layer: 
- responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes.
- responsible for transmission of the raw data, which is simply a series of 0s and 1s.
- e.g. optical fiber, coaxial cable, wireless, etc.
- major protocols used by this layer include Bluetooth, PON, OTN, DSL, IEEE.802.11, IEEE.802.3, L431 and TIA 449.

2. Layer 2, the Data Link Layer: 
- establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes
- breaks up packets into frames and sends them from source to destination. two parts...
- Logical Link Control (LLC), which identifies network protocols, performs error checking and synchronizes frames by adding headers to data packets.
- Media Access Control (MAC) which uses MAC addresses to connect devices and define permissions to transmit and receive data.
- The protocols are used by the Data Link Layer include: ARP, CSLIP, HDLC, IEEE.802.3, PPP, X-25, SLIP, ATM, SDLS and PLIP.

3. Layer 3, the Network Layer: 
- breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end.
- routing packets by discovering the best path across a physical network.
- Internet Protocol (IPv4), Internet Protocol (IPv6), IPX, AppleTalk, ICMP, IPSec and IGMP.

4. Layer 4, the Transport Layer: 
- takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end.
- responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving end, turning it back into data that can be used by the session layer.
- carries out flow control, sending data at a rate that matches the connection speed of the receiving device
- provides error control, checking if data was received incorrectly and if not, requesting it again.
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), UDP, SPX, DCCP and SCTP.

5. Layer 5, the Session Layer: 
- 

6. Layer 6, the Presentation Layer: 

7. Layer 7, the Application Layer:
