## Basics:
-  Both models gives a `way of transmitting data over the internet.`
- was driven by the `need for standardization and a systematic approach to understanding and implementing network communication.`
-  `need for devices from different manufacturers to communicate`
- `breaking down the complex task of network communication into manageable parts`

## TCP vs OSI: `Protocol vs Reference Model`

## 1. TCP/IP; `4 Layers`
- Practical model that addresses specific communication challenges and relies on standardized protocols.
- Widely implemented in the ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet & designed and developed by the United States Department of Defense.

```
Link Layer (or Network Access Layer)
Internet Layer
Transport Layer
Application Layer
```


## 2. OSI serves: `7 Layers`
- comprehensive, protocol-independent framework designed to encompass various network communication methods.
- Introduced later as a conceptual framework in the late 1970s by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

```
Physical Layer
Data Link Layer
Network Layer
Transport Layer
Session Layer
Presentation Layer
Application Layer
