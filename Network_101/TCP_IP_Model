1. Application Layer:
- This layer performs the functions of the top three layers of the OSI model, i.e., Application, Presentation, and Session Layer. It is responsible for node-to-node communication and controls user-interface specifications.

2. Host-to-Host/Transport Layer:
- This layer is similar to the OSI model's Transport layer. It specifies how much data should be sent, when, and where at what rate.

3. Internet/Network Layer: 
- The Internet layer's primary function is to send packets from the source or computer to their destination, regardless of their route. 

4. Network Access Layer/Link Layer:
- Network access or Link layer specifies the physical transmission of data over the network.
- It also determines how bits should be optically signalled by hardware devices that interface directly with a network media such as coaxial, optical, fiber, or twisted-pair cables.

Gists:
1. Application Layer is responsible for node-to-node communication and controls user-interface specifications. HTTP, SMTP, TELNET, etc., are some of its essential protocols.
2. Host-To-Host Layer specifies how much data should be sent, when, and where at what rate. TCP and UDP are two significant protocols of this Layer.
3. The Internet layer's primary function is to send packets from the source or computer to their destination, regardless of their route. IP and ARP are two significant protocols of this layer.
4. Network Acess Layer handles data transmission between two adjacent devices on the same network.
