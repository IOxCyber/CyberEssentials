## IP Address:
- "Internet Protocol," set of rules to send data via the internet or local network.
- IP (NH): 32 bits in an IPv4 address, 4 Octet(1 octet = 8 bits), two parts i.e network and host.
- network part identifies the class of network & host part uniquely identifies the machines on your network.

## To get IPs:
1. Windows: run ipconfig > under Specific Adapter: IPv4 Address
2. Linux: run ifconfig > under eth0: Next to inet IP

## IP Address Type:
1. Public IP: Global, external, used in  Wide Area Network (WAN), accessed directly over the internet and is assigned to network router by internet service provider (ISP)
2. Private IP: Local, used in the Local Area Network (LAN), Automatically generated by router & assigns to internal devices. Each device within the same network is assigned a unique private IP address.


## IP Class: 
- IP Address ranges, private IP address exists within specific ranges reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and should never appear on the internet. 
> Class A: 1-126 (network,node,node,node)
> Class B: 128-191 (network,network,node,node)
> Class C: 192-223 (network,network,network,node)
> Class D - reserved for multicasting
> Class E - not used on the internet, only used by the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF.)


## Subnetting: [more](https://avinetworks.com/glossary/subnet-mask/)
1. Subnet mask: [more](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/subnetting-subnet-masks-explained/#:~:text=A%20class%20C%20network%20would,24%20following%20the%20IP%20address.)
- logically partitioning a single physical network (IP) into multiple smaller sub-networks or subnets i.e Network(1st) & Host(2nd)
- The “255” address is always assigned to a broadcast address, and the “0” address is always assigned to a network address.

- Default Subnet Mask of IP classess:
> Class A: 255.0.0.0
> Class B: 255.255.0.0
> Class C: 255.255.255.0

2. Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation:

## Computer Network Types:
- Ethernet (Local Area Network), WLAN (Wi-Fi), or WAN (Wide Area Network)


## Devices
1. Router: Device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. manage traffic between WAN & LAN by forwarding data packets to intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
2. Hubs: quick but indiscriminate; when it receives a data packet, it will copy it and send it to every device connected to it.
3. Switches: Slower but responsible; when it receives a data packet, it determines & send the data only to intended devices.
4. Gateway: Default Gateway is router IP.
5. Hop: It refers to the *number of routers* that a packet passes through from its source to its destination, By which we can determine if the device in Same network or not.


## Protocols
*TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol)*:
+
Connection-oriented, build connection before transmitting data.
Reliable; guarantees delivery by retransmission of data, Checks for errors in data packets
Sequenced, packets arrive in-order at the receiving device.
-
Slower than UDP due to error checking, building connection, gurantees delivery.
Unable to execute broadcasting tasks.

Uses: Email, World Wide Web (HTTP, HTTPS)


*UCP (User Datagram Protocol)*:
+
Faster,Simple in its transmission, limited data management.
Supports broadcasting tasks.

-
Unreliable, cannot guarantee packet delivery due to being datagram-oriented rather than connection-oriented.
No retransmission, Minimal error checking.
No sequencing, packets may arrive out of order.
Can overload the receiver, only stops sending data once the task is completed.

Uses: Video Streaming, Online Gaming
