## IP Address:
- "Internet Protocol," set of rules to send data via the internet or local network.
- IP (NH): 32 bits in an IPv4 address, 4 Octet(1 octet = 8 bits), two parts i.e network and host.
- network part identifies the class of network & host part uniquely identifies the machines on your network.

## To get IPs:
1. Windows: run ipconfig > under Specific Adapter: IPv4 Address
2. Linux: run ifconfig > under eth0: Next to inet IP

## IP Address Type:
1. Public IP: Global, external, used in  Wide Area Network (WAN), accessed directly over the internet and is assigned to network router by internet service provider (ISP)
2. Private IP: Local, used in the Local Area Network (LAN), Automatically generated by router & assigns to internal devices. Each device within the same network is assigned a unique private IP address.


## IP Class: You can identify the class of an IP address by looking at its first octet.
- IP Address ranges, private IP address exists within specific ranges reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and should never appear on the internet. 
> Class A: 1-126 (network,node,node,node)
> 
> Class B: 128-191 (network,network,node,node)
> 
> Class C: 192-223 (network,network,network,node)
> 
> Class D - reserved for multicasting
> - 224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255
> 
> Class E - not used on the internet, only used by the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF.)
> - Experimental purposes only for R&D or Study. IP addresses in this class ranges from 240.0. 0.0 to 255.255. 255.254


## Subnetting: [more](https://avinetworks.com/glossary/subnet-mask/)
## 1. Subnet mask(Useful to determine the Network & Host Bits): [more](http://www.steves-internet-guide.com/subnetting-subnet-masks-explained/#:~:text=A%20class%20C%20network%20would,24%20following%20the%20IP%20address.)
- logically partitioning a single physical network (IP) into multiple smaller sub-networks or subnets i.e Network(1st) & Host(2nd)
- The “255” address is always assigned to a broadcast address, and the “0” address is always assigned to a network address.

> Class A: 255.0.0.0 (255/1st 8 bits for Network ID)
> 
> Class B: 255.255.0.0 (255/1st 16 bits for Network ID)
> 
> Class C: 255.255.255.0 (255/1st 24 bits for Network ID)

## 2. Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation: x.x.x.x/(network bits)
- a method of public IP address assignment.
- Class A – the classful subnet mask is /8. The number of possible Host IP addresses is 16,777,214.
- Class B – the classful subnet mask is /16. The number of Host IP addresses is 65,534
- Class C – the classful subnet mask is /24. Only 254 Host IP addresses are available
> Note: The number of usable IP addresses can be calculated: 2 ^ host bits – 2

## Computer Network Types:
- Ethernet (Local Area Network)
- WLAN (Wi-Fi)
- WAN (Wide Area Network)


## Network Devices
1. Router: Device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. manage traffic between WAN & LAN by forwarding data packets to intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
2. Hubs: quick but indiscriminate; when it receives a data packet, it will copy it and send it to every device connected to it.
3. Switches: Slower but responsible; when it receives a data packet, it determines & send the data only to intended devices.
4. Gateway: Default Gateway is router IP.
5. Hop: It refers to the *number of routers* that a packet passes through from its source to its destination, By which we can determine if the device in Same network or not.
