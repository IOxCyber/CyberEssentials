# Basic Terms:

## Risk Management: `Risk Assessment + Risk Analysis + Risk Evalution + Risk Priorization`

## Risk Assessment: `Risk Analysis + Risk Categorize` the risk associated with Assests.

## Risk Analysis: `Identifying & Analysing risk, vulnerability & their impact on system.`

## Risk Evaluation: `Comparing the result of risk Analysis with Risk Criteria.`

## Risk Quantification: `Assigning the Number to the risk [0-5]`

## Risk Likelihood: `Probability of a threat exploiting a vulnerability & causing harm.`

## Risk Treatment: Implementing the controls to `Reduce, Accept, transfer or Avoid` of Identified risks.
### 1. To Reduce: 
- A Strategic Document specifies the actions, Controls & Guidelines to manage and mitigate Identified Risk.
- Risk reduction, also known as risk mitigation, involves implementing controls or measures to decrease the risk to an acceptable level.

### Ways to Reduce Risks:
1. Segmentation and Isolation: Limiting access or isolating sensitive systems to reduce the attack surface.
2. Encryption: Protecting sensitive data through encryption to reduce the impact.
3. Regular Patching and Updates: Keeping systems and applications updated.
4. Employee Training, Physical Security etc

### 2. To Accept:  
- If risk falls within the organizationâ€™s risk tolerance or if the cost of mitigating the risk > the benefits.
- eg. `Low Impact and Likelihood, Cost-Prohibitive Risks, Inherent Risks in Market, Minor Technical Issues`

### How to Accept Risk:
- Document the Decision, Monitor the Risk continuously, Communicate the same to stakeholders with justification.

### 3. To Transfer:
- Risk transfer involves transferring the responsibility for managing a risk to another party.Eg. Financial Risks, Operational Risks. `Typically through contracts, insurance, or outsourcing.`

### 4. To Avoid:
- To eliminate a risk by not engaging in activities that generate the risk ie. `High Impact and High Likelihood, Unnecessary Risks.`
- eg. Health and Safety Risk, 

> Natural calamities like earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters typically fall under the Risk Transfer or Risk Avoidance
