## What: 
`Way to identify, analyze & evaluate risks within an org or a specific context`

## Steps:
1. Establish the Context:
- `Define the scope` and boundaries of the risk assessment.
- `Understand Requirements`: Know the compliance requirements for standards like ISO 27001, NIST, CIS, or HIPAA.
- `Set Objectives`: Define the goals of the risk assessment, such as identifying critical vulnerabilities or evaluating the effectiveness of current controls.

2. Identify Risks `Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities`
- Asset Inventory: List all information assets (e.g., databases, servers, applications). Identify asset owners and categorize assets based on their importance.
- Threat Modeling: Identify potential threats, such as cyberattacks, natural disasters, or insider threats, and map them to specific assets.
- Vulnerability Assessment: Use automated tools (e.g., Nessus, Qualys) to identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
- Interviews and Questionnaires: Engage with stakeholders and employees to identify potential risks based on their experiences and observations.

3. Analyze Risks:
-
