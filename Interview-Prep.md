## IDS vs IPS:
- IDS: Intrusion Detection System, `Monitor In/Out traffic for known attack methods, malware, or unauthorized access. Focus on Detecting & Alerting.`
- IPS: Intrusion Prevention System, `Monitor as well as block access when malicious activity. Focus on preventing and blocking unauthorized access.`


## Encoding, Encryption, Hashing:
- Encoding: `Convert data from one format to another, For transmission/Storage, Reversible. eg. URL encoding, Base64 encoding.`
- Encryption: `Plain text to Cipher text, For Securing transmission/Storage data, Reversible. eg. AES, RSA, SSL/TLS Encryption`
- Hashing: `Convert Input data of any size into a Fixed-size string, For data integrity and verification, Non-Reversible. eg. MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 for Password storage & file integrity check`

## Traceroute: `Used to trace the route that a data packet takes from a source to destination`

## NAT:

## VPN: `Allow a secure & encrypted connection to access the internet or private network through a remote user.`
## IP Leaking: If a connection from the user to the VPN Client drops/interupts then, it may cause IP Leaking.

## 3-way-handshaking: `TCP is more of the connection between 2 points or establishing a link. And, SSL/TLS is more of securing that link. SSL/TLS happens after the 3-way-handshaking.
