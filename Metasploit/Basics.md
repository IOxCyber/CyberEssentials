- information gathering to post-exploitation.
- a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more.
- Components:
  - msfconsole: The main command-line interface.
  - Modules: small components built to perform a specific task, such as exploiting a vulnerability, scanning a target, or performing a brute-force attack.
  - Tools: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing.

> Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.
> Exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
> Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system.

- Auxiliary: Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers can be found in this.
- Encoders: Allow you to encode the exploit and payload (a [^1]signature-based antivirus solution detects them)

















[^1]: a type of security software that uses signatures to identify malware. Signatures are bits of code that are unique to a specific piece of malware.
