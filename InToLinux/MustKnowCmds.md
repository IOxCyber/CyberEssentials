1. wget: 
- stands for web get. The wget is a free non-interactive file downloader command. 
- Non-interactive means it can work in background when user is not logged in. This allows user to get disconnected with the system while wget finish its work.
- eg. wget http://website.com/files/file.zip

2. curl:
- Use to transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP, or FILE).
- This tool is preferred for automation since it is designed to work without user interaction. curl can transfer multiple files at once.
- Wget is a simple transfer utility, while curl offers so much more.
- eg. curl [options] [URL...]
