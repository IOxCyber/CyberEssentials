### Installing Packages
- 1. `sudo apt-get update`
- 2. `apt-cache search [keyword]` (Package files are commonly installed by downloading them directly from repositories located on Internet servers. The Debian repositories contain more than 65,000 different packages of software. Before installing a package, it is good practice to refresh the list of available packages)
- 3. `sudo apt-get install [package]`
- 4. `apt-get upgrade`

### Removing Packages
- `apt-get remove` [package] (removing deletes all files except the configuration files for the package)
- `apt-get purge` [package] (purging deletes all package files including configuration files for the package)
