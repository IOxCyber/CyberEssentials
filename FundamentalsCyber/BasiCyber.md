## Key Terms:
- **Vulnerability: Gap/Weakness** in the system. eg. door with a fragile lock
- **Risk: Potential damage, or loss of data or assets**. Also, Asset + Threat + Vulnerability = Risk.
- **Threat: Event that can exploit the vulnerability** or Something that can damage or destroy an asset. eg. DDoS, phishing, SQL injection, man-in-the-middle (MitM), and malware, natural disasters.
- **Exploit: The mechanism** that someone uses to get into system. eg. keys, hammer, or lockpick to break the fragile lock.
- **Payloads: piece of code**, eg. Trojans/RATs, keyloggers, reverse shells.
- **Zero Day: Unknown Vulnerabilities** to User & Owner.
- Doxxing: Making private data publicaly available for exposure, finanacial harm etc.
- **Botnet: Infected network of computers**. 
- - Eg. First, a vulnerability exposes your organization to threats. 
- - Second, A threat is a malicious or negative event that takes advantage of a vulnerability. 
- - Finally, the risk is the potential for loss and damage when the threat occurs.

## Security Elements: C.I.A.A.A.N
> CIA Triads: + Authentication, Authorization, Non-Repudiation(Accountability)
- **Confidentiality: Data is private to the owners**. Eg. Algo(AES,
- **Integrity: Data is untempered**. Eg. Hashing Algo(MD5, SHA )
- **Availability: Accessibility of networks, systems, applications, and data** by authorized users. Eg. DoS (Denial of Service) 
- **Authentication: Identity of a user or service.** Integrity Comes with Authenticity.
- **Authorization: Access rights of a user.**
- **Non-Repudiation: Accountability of a user.**


## SFU - Triangle: Security, Functionality, Usability
- Any Information System will have a perfect balance between security, functionality, and usability.
- IF any one of these goes up, other 2 will go down.
