# Encryption algorithms are cryptographic techniques used to transform plain text (unencrypted data) into ciphertext (encrypted data).

## Symmetric Encryption & Asymmetric:
1. Symmetric Encryption:
- Single Key for encryption of Actual data.
- Fast & for Large data
- Faster & more efficient but require a secure method of key distribution.

2. Asymmetric:
- 2 key (Public & Private)
- Slow & for minimum data
- Stronger security & key management
- To Encryption key exchange &  authentication.

## 1. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):
   - Description: `AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm` widely adopted as the standard for secure communication and data protection.
   - Real-life application: used in `secure file storage, virtual private networks (VPNs), wireless network security (WPA2)`, and secure messaging applications.
   - Application: `secure email (S/MIME), secure instant messaging (Signal Protocol like WhatsApp), and secure cloud storage services.`

## 2. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):
   - Description: RSA is an `asymmetric encryption algorithm` that relies on the practical difficulty of factoring large composite numbers to ensure secure communication and digital signatures.
   - Real-life application: RSA is widely used for `secure key exchange, digital certificates, secure email (PGP/GPG), and secure web browsing (SSL/TLS).`
   - Application: RSA is used in applications like `secure email (PGP/GPG), secure web browsing (SSL/TLS), and secure cloud services (encryption of data at rest).`

## 3. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):
   - Description: `provide strong security with shorter key lengths compared to other algorithms like RSA.`
   - Real-life application: ECC is used in `secure messaging applications, secure mobile communication (e.g., Signal), and secure web browsing (e.g., HTTPS).`
   - Application: ECC is used in applications like `secure messaging applications (Signal), secure web browsing (HTTPS), and secure voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication.`

## 4. Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA): SHA-256, SHA 3 (256 or 512)
   - Description: used for `data integrity and generating unique hash values of the data.`
   - Real-life application: used in `digital signatures, password hashing (e.g., bcrypt), blockchain technology, and data integrity (File Verification).`
   - Application: SHA algorithms are used in applications like `digital signatures (RSA with SHA-256), password hashing (bcrypt, PBKDF2), and blockchain technology (Bitcoin, Ethereum).`
   > In SHA, if the fixed-size hash value is 256 bits or 32 bytes long then no matter the length or complexity of the input data (a file, message, or any other input), the resulting hash value will always be a 256-bit string of characters. 

## 5. Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES):
   - Description: `symmetric encryption algorithm that applies the DES algorithm three times in succession to provide enhanced security.`
   - Real-life application: 3DES is used in legacy systems and applications that require backward compatibility with older encryption standards.
   - Application: 3DES is used in applications like `secure banking transactions, legacy VPNs, and payment systems.`

## 6. Blowfish:
   - Description: `symmetric encryption algorithm designed for fast and secure data encryption.`
   - Real-life application: used in various applications that require `encryption, including secure file transfer protocols and disk encryption.`
   - Application: Blowfish is used in applications like `secure FTP (SFTP), secure email, and password storage systems.`

## 7. Twofish:
   - Description: Twofish is a `symmetric encryption algorithm` known for its flexibility and strong security.
   - Real-life application: Twofish has been used in a range of applications, including secure communication protocols and disk encryption.
   - Application: Twofish has been used in applications like secure email, VPNs, and encrypted storage devices.

## 8. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS):
   - Description: SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols that `provide secure communication over networks.`
   - Real-life application: `SSL/TLS is widely used to secure web browsing (HTTPS), secure email transmission (SMTPS), and secure virtual private networks (SSL VPNs).`
   - Application: SSL/TLS is used in applications like secure web browsing (HTTPS), secure email transmission (SMTPS, IMAPS), and secure network communication.

## 9. ChaCha20:
   - Description: `symmetric encryption algorithm` known for its speed and resistance against certain types of attacks.
   - Real-life application: ChaCha20 is used in secure messaging applications, disk encryption, and network protocols.
   - Application: ChaCha20 is used in applications like secure messaging protocols (Signal Protocol), disk encryption (VeraCrypt), and secure network protocols (OpenVPN).
