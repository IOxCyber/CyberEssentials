## IP Address:
"Internet Protocol," set of rules to send data via the internet or local network.

## IP Address Type:
Public IP: Global, external, used in  Wide Area Network (WAN), accessed directly over the internet and is assigned to network router by internet service provider (ISP)
Private IP: Local, used in the Local Area Network (LAN), Automatically generated by router & assigns to internal devices. Each device within the same network is assigned a unique private IP address.


## IP Class: 
IP Address ranges, private IP address exists within specific ranges reserved by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and should never appear on the internet. 
Class A: 10.0.0.0 — 10.255.255.255
Class B: 172.16.0.0 — 172.31.255.255 
Class C: 192.168.0.0 — 192.168.255.255 

## Subnetting:
Subnet mask:
CIDR Notation:

## Computer Network Types:
Ethernet (Local Area Network), WLAN (Wi-Fi), or WAN (Wide Area Network)


## Security Devices:
Proxy Server:
Firewalls: 
VPN:


## Devices
Router: Device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. manage traffic between WAN & LAN by forwarding data packets to intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
Modem: 
Hubs: quick but indiscriminate; when it receives a data packet, it will copy it and send it to every device connected to it.
Switches: Slower but responsible; when it receives a data packet, it determines & send the data only to intended devices.
Gateway:

## Protocols
*TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol)*:
+
Connection-oriented, build connection before transmitting data.
Reliable; guarantees delivery by retransmission of data, Checks for errors in data packets
Sequenced, packets arrive in-order at the receiving device.
-
Slower than UDP due to error checking, building connection, gurantees delivery.
Unable to execute broadcasting tasks.

Uses: Email, World Wide Web (HTTP, HTTPS)


*UCP (User Datagram Protocol)*:
+
Faster,Simple in its transmission, limited data management.
Supports broadcasting tasks.

-
Unreliable, cannot guarantee packet delivery due to being datagram-oriented rather than connection-oriented.
No retransmission, Minimal error checking.
No sequencing, packets may arrive out of order.
Can overload the receiver, only stops sending data once the task is completed.

Uses: Video Streaming, Online Gaming
